#Serenity
[Anodyne Xtras](https://xtras.anodyne-productions.com/item/Krace/serenity)
This is a skin for Anodyne Productions' Nova 2 RPG Management System. It includes a number of mods: 
 * infobox mod, updated to include some new improvements.
 * a modified version of Wolfie's Manifest Picture and Card Layout mod, with an extra bit to allow it to work on the chain of command page also.
 * something new for this skin, which changes the behaviour of the logged in controls. With this mod, rather than using an icon next to the label or image to denote an unread message or post, the image itself changes.

The skin also reduces duplication. If you want to change the styles of a skin, you now only need to modify the `skin.css` file in the `_global` directory, and the changes will be reflected across all sections of the site. An overrides file exists in each skin section area to define styles that only apply to that skin section.

Note: for both the infobox and manifest image mods, it works best for images that are either square or tall. Wide images tend to leave blank space at the bottom of the display.
